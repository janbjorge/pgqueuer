# PgQueuer Documentation

Welcome to the PgQueuer project! This documentation provides an overview of the PgQueuer system, installation instructions, and basic usage examples to help you get started.

## Overview

PgQueuer is a powerful job queue system designed for asynchronous processing of tasks in Python applications. It allows you to enqueue jobs and process them in the background, making it ideal for handling tasks such as sending emails, processing data, and more.

## Installation

To install PgQueuer, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install pgqueuer
```

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

## Quickstart

To quickly get started with PgQueuer, follow the steps outlined in the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md). This guide will walk you through the initial setup, configuration, and basic commands to run your first job.

## Usage Examples

### Enqueuing Jobs

You can create a producer to enqueue jobs using the following code:

```python
from pgqueuer import PgQueuer

async def enqueue_job():
    pgq = PgQueuer()
    await pgq.enqueue("job_name", {"key": "value"})
```

### Running the Consumer

To process the jobs you have enqueued, you need to run a consumer. Refer to the [Consumer Documentation](consumer.md) for detailed instructions on setting up and running the consumer.
