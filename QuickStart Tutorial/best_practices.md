# Best Practices for Using PgQueuer

## Error Handling

1. **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Always handle exceptions in your job handlers to prevent job failures from crashing the consumer. Use try-except blocks to catch and log errors.

2. **Use Custom Error Classes**: Define custom error classes for different types of errors to make it easier to handle specific cases.

3. **Graceful Job Failures**: Ensure that jobs can fail gracefully and that the system can recover from errors without losing data.

## Performance Optimization

1. **Batch Processing**: Enqueue jobs in batches to reduce the overhead of multiple database calls. This can significantly improve throughput.

2. **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling for database connections to minimize the overhead of establishing connections for each job.

3. **Prioritize Jobs**: Use job priorities effectively to ensure that critical jobs are processed first. Define clear priority levels for different types of jobs.

4. **Optimize Database Queries**: Ensure that your database queries are optimized for performance. Use indexes where necessary and avoid complex joins in job processing.

## Job Management

1. **Use Job Dependencies**: Define dependencies between jobs to ensure that jobs are executed in the correct order. This is particularly useful for workflows that require multiple steps.

2. **Scheduled Jobs**: Utilize scheduled jobs for recurring tasks. This can help automate regular maintenance or reporting tasks without manual intervention.

3. **Monitor Job Status**: Regularly monitor the status of jobs to identify any that are stuck or failing. Use the built-in dashboard or CLI commands for monitoring.

## Documentation and Testing

1. **Document Job Handlers**: Maintain clear documentation for each job handler, including its purpose, expected input, and potential errors.

2. **Write Tests**: Implement unit tests and integration tests for your job handlers to ensure they work as expected. This helps catch issues early in the development process.

3. **Use Mocking for External Calls**: When testing job handlers that make external calls, use mocking to simulate responses and avoid hitting real services.

## Security Considerations

1. **Sanitize Inputs**: Always sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks or other security vulnerabilities.

2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information, such as database credentials, in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your application.

3. **Limit Job Permissions**: Ensure that jobs run with the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks, following the principle of least privilege.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your implementation of PgQueuer is efficient, reliable, and secure.
