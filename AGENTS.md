# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Structure for OpenAI Codex Navigation

- `/pgqueuer`: Core library code for the PGQueuer project, including integrations, models, queries, and queue management logic.
- `/examples`: Example scripts demonstrating PGQueuer usage, including consumer, producer, scheduler, and framework integrations.
- `/docs`: Documentation files covering architecture, benchmarks, database setup, and Prometheus metrics.
- `/test`: Test files for unit tests, integration tests, and other test cases.
- `/tools`: Utility scripts for benchmarking and monitoring.

## Pre-Setup Instructions for PostgreSQL Docker Container

To set up a PostgreSQL instance for development and testing, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. Use the following `docker compose` command to start a PostgreSQL container and auto-install PGQueuer:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d db populate
   ```
3. Verify that the PostgreSQL container is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
4. Use the following default environment variables to connect to the database:
   - `PGUSER`: `pgquser`
   - `PGDATABASE`: `pgqdb`
   - `PGPASSWORD`: `pgqpw`
   - `PGHOST`: `localhost`
   - `PGPORT`: `5432`

These settings are pre-configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
