"""
Tests demonstrating correct and incorrect use of async (eventâ€‘loop bound) resources
inside sync entrypoints.

Context
-------
Sync entrypoints in PgQueuer run in a worker thread via anyio.to_thread.run_sync.
Async resources (e.g. asyncpg pools, httpx.AsyncClient, arbitrary async callables)
MUST NOT be invoked directly inside these sync functions, because that produces an
un-awaited coroutine (or worse, tries to interact with the loop from the wrong thread).

These tests showcase:
1. Misuse: Directly calling an async dependency inside a sync entrypoint -> returns a coroutine.
2. Correct bridging: Using anyio.from_thread.run (imported as from_thread.run) to schedule/await
   the async callable back on the main event loop.
3. Drain mode usage: We use QueueExecutionMode.drain instead of a custom loop/shutdown helper.

They serve both as documentation and regression coverage to ensure the current
behavior (no hidden magic making async objects thread-safe) remains explicit.
