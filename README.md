## PgQueuer

PgQueuer is a minimalist, high-performance job queue library for Python, leveraging the robustness of PostgreSQL. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, PgQueuer uses PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY to manage job queues effortlessly.

### Features

- **Simple Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing Python applications using PostgreSQL.
- **Efficient Concurrency Handling**: Utilizes PostgreSQL's `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for reliable and concurrent job processing.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Leverages `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` for real-time updates on job status changes.

### Installation

To install PgQueuer, simply install with pip the following command:

```bash
pip install PgQueuer
```

### Example Usage

Here's how you can use PgQueuer in a typical scenario processing incoming data messages:

```python
import asyncio

import asyncpg
from PgQueuer.models import Job
from PgQueuer.qm import QueueManager


async def main() -> None:
    pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(min_size=2)
    qm = QueueManager(pool)

    N = 1_000
    # Enqueue messages.
    for n in range(N):
        await qm.queries.enqueue("fetch", f"this is from me: {n}".encode())

    @qm.entrypoint("fetch")
    async def process_message(job: Job) -> None:
        print(f"Processed message: {job}")

    await qm.run()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Database Configuration

PgQueuer provides a command-line interface for easy management of installation and uninstallation. Ensure you have configured your [environment variables](https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/api/index.html#connection) or use the appropriate flags to specify your database credentials.

- **Installing PgQueuer Database Components**:
  ```bash
  python -m PgQueuer install 
  ```

- **Uninstalling PgQueuer Database Components**:
  ```bash
  python -m PgQueuer uninstall 
  ```

The CLI supports several flags to customize the connection settings. Use `--help` to see all available options.

#### Dashboard Command

The dashboard command provides a real-time view of job processing statistics, which can be refreshed at a specified interval. This is particularly useful for monitoring the status of jobs dynamically. Below are the options available for customizing the dashboard display:

  - `--interval <seconds>`: Set the refresh interval in seconds for updating the dashboard display. If not set, the dashboard will update only once and then exit.
  - `--tail <number>`: Specify the number of the most recent log entries to display.
  - `--table-format <format>`: Choose the format of the table used to display statistics. Supported formats include grid, plain, html, and others provided by the tabulate library.

Example command to launch the dashboard:
```bash
python -m PgQueuer dashboard --interval 10 --tail 25 --table-format grid
```

Example output from the dashboard:
```bash

```

#### Listen Command

The `listen` command allows you to monitor PostgreSQL NOTIFY messages in real-time on a specified channel. This feature is particularly useful for debugging and observing the raw event traffic that your application handles.

**Usage**:
```bash
python -m PgQueuer listen 
```

Example output from listen:
```bash
Event(channel='ch_pgqueuer', operation='truncate', sent_at=datetime.datetime(2024, 5, 11, 20, 15, 16, 123135, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), table='pgqueuer', received_at=datetime.datetime(2024, 5, 11, 20, 15, 16, 129818, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc))
